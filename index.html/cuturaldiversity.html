      <h1>Sakela</h1> 
      <p>Sakela is actually a word from Rai language which means ‘Sakela Nach’. So, it’s basically the type of dance, which Kirant Rai people perform during their main festival ‘Ubhauli’ and ‘Udhauli’. It’s well said that Kirant Rai people used to perform this dance during celebrating these festivals for the god/goddess Sumnima and Paruhang. Now, in today’s modern times, even though people have migrated to urban areas or even abroad where they don’t have to do the paddy cultivation/harvesting stuff, they celebrate the festivals during the exact months of the year as a step to keep their culture safe and get handed over to next generations properly. </p>

      <h1>Ubhauli Udhauli </h1> 
      <p>Ubhauli is derived from the Nepali word ‘Ubho – going up’ and Udhauli is derived from the word ‘Udho – going down’. According to Kirant ancient religious scripture, Mundhum, a year is divided into these two phases. During the spring, as the snow starts to melt, trees leaves take rebirth, flowers bloom and the temperature rises, birds and animals start to move from lowlands to highlands. Whereas, during the fall, the temperature starts to fall and birds and animals move towards lowlands from highland. So, the term Ubhauli came from the upward migration pattern and Udhauli came from a downward migration pattern of the group of Gheese bird. </p>
